# ðŸŒ¸OpenNest-Africa: Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

---

At OpenNest-Africa, we are committed to creating a welcoming and safe space where everyoneâ€”no matter their background or skill levelâ€”feels valued and supported.

Whether you're here to code, design, write, or just explore, we want you to know: you belong here. We pledge to foster a positive, inclusive environment where every person can learn, contribute, and grow without fear of discrimination or harassment.

### Our Standards

---

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Scope

---

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforce Responsibilities

---

The Code of Conduct Committee responds to, investigates, and resolves OpenNest-Africa Incidents. The Committee is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

The Committee has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. The Committee may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behaviors to the community.

### Enforcement

---

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at coc@opennestafrica.io. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
